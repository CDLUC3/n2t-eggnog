Revision history for noid script and Noid module.

0.5     Synchronization with Java version of Noid-je 0.5.
        Directory and module name change to avoid conflicts on
        case-sensitive filesystems (eg, Mac OS): the main "NOID"
	directory became "dbnoid".  Changes to improve portability,
	including use of File::Spec.  Removed reliance on locking
	and transaction subsystems of BerkeleyDB.  Fixed bug in
	error return from 'queue'.
	ActivePerl: catfile, srand can't be called multiple times xxxxx

0.424	Some portability fixes.  Added notes to README file on installation
	of noid and its prerequisites in user space, with addition of a
	step to untaint PERL5LIB (which wasn't getting through).

0.423	Documentation fixes.

0.422	Fixed flock bug.

0.421	Initial release.
