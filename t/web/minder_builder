# It deals with more frequently occurring resolution cases that should
# appear (via early "Include") before less frequently occurring cases.

# NB: The "prg:" programs won't start up properly until the binders they
#     open actually exist.  You cannot easily create them within a test
#     script that starts by starting apache, so we create them beforehand.

# Each of these programs needs a corresponding create_test_rmap call
# AND a rewrite rule for when a specific single resolver is requested
# (using ^/r/...) by a user/tester.

# xxx these rules actually drive some tests in t/apachebase.t,
#     which is the wrong way to do tests -- do this more cleanly
