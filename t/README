Filenames follow patterns:

 *egg_* = tests egg mostly
 *nog_* = tests nog mostly
 *egn_* = apache tests with egg and nog

Directories contain configuration for web services:

  n2t = for n2t-specific services
        (tested by egn_service_n2t.t and z_egg_prefixes_n2t.t)
  web = for generic services
        (tested by egn_apachebase.t)

NB: z_egg_prefixes_n2t begins with 'z' so that the server it builds via
'make test' sorts, and therefore runs, last. This permits the flag file
it leaves (to indicate whether the current prefixes "tested_ok") to be
checked by a subsequent 'n2t rollout && n2t test'.
