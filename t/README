Filenames follow patterns:

 *egg_* = tests egg mostly
 *nog_* = tests nog mostly
 *egn_* = apache tests with egg and nog

Directories contain configuration for web services:

  n2t = for n2t-specific services
        (tested by egn_service_n2t.t and z_egg_prefixes_n2t.t)
  web = for generic services
        (tested by egn_apachebase.t)

NB: z_egg_prefixes_n2t begins with 'z' so that it runs last with

  run 'make test'

as it builds a fresh prefix file ready for 'n2t rollout && n2t test'
(this is a bit of a kludge).
