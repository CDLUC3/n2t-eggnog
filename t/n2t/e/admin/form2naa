NAME
    $cmd - convert a NAAN request form to a registry entry

SYNOPSIS
    $cmd [ --github ] FormFile [ NAAN ]

DESCRIPTION
    XXX heavily modified for the "-" stdin case, expecting
    XXX when invoked via web, there will never be a NAAN arg
    If any of the first 3 lines are empty, we're not doing this for real.
       line 1: email
       line 2: your name (given name then family name, eg, Sam Smith)
       line 3: NAAN
       lines 4-: form output

    The $cmd script converts a NAAN request form to a registry entry that
    is stored in the current directory under the filename, "$new_naa_file".

    The FormFile is a file of form data in YAML (or CSV format, but CSV is
    not really tested). Data is usually entered via the
    https://goo.gl/forms/bmckLSPpbzpZ5dix1 form and delivered either by
    downloading a CSV file or pasting from an email generated from the
    filled-out form. If FormFile is given as '-', its contents are
    expected on stdin.

    If the NAAN is not given as a command argument, it should be given as
    head of a small block of form data in the FormFile. The block begins
    with the NAAN on a line by itself, and the remaining block lines should
    contain filled out form data up to a line starting "----". Unless the
    --github option is given, that block must be line 1 of FormFile; this
    option supports use of this script running in a github workflow (which
    allows the maintainer not to have to run under a Unix-like platform).
    
    Before calling, the caller will have selected the NAAN by editing the
    ./candidate_naans file and moving the top unassigned NAAN up over the
    line into the assigned NAANs part of the file.  As an example, the
    received form

Please note that $naan is intended for assigning ARKs to content that your institution directly curates or creates.
In case you work with other institutions that use your tools and services for content that they curate or create, those institutions should have their own NAANs.
</p><p>
In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful to consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes of, say 1-5 characters, eg, names of the form "ark:/$naan/xt3...." for each "sub-publisher" in an organization.
Opaque prefixes that only have meaning to information professionals are often a good idea and have precedent in schemes such as ISBN and ISSN.

The best starting place for information on ARKs (Archival Resource Keys) is the
<a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ARKs/ARK+Identifiers+FAQ">ARKs FAQ</a>
(<a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=178880619">version française</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.lyrasis.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=185991610">version en español</a>)
and <a href="http://n2t.net/e/ark_ids.html">this ARK identifier overview</a>.
The <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13030/c7cv4br18">ARK specification</a> is currently the best guide for how to create URLs that comply with ARK rules, although it is fairly technical.
There is a <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/arks-forum">public discussion group for ARKs</a>
(<a href="https://framalistes.org/sympa/info/arks-forum-fr">forum francophone</a>)
intended for people interested in sharing with and learning from others about how ARKs have been or could be used in identifier applications.
The best open source software for setting up your own ARK service implementation is currently <a href="http://n2t.net/e/noid.html">Noid</a>.
</p><p>
There's nothing else you need to do right now.
As you may know, there's an initiative to build an open, international community around ARKs, <a href="http://ARKsInTheOpen.org">ARKsInTheOpen.org<a/>.
We're also drafting some <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:/13030/c7833mx7t">standardized persistence statements</a> that name assigning authorities can begin testing (feedback is welcome) and using if they wish.

#While no payment is required to use the ARK scheme, there are optional fee-based services that can help with technical and management tasks.
#For example, the California Digital Library (CDL) provides a fee-based service called EZID (https://ezid.cdlib.org) that you can use to manage your namespace, which includes minting and resolving ARKs, as well as maintaining metadata.
#Please contact ezid\@ucop.edu if you are interested in EZID.
