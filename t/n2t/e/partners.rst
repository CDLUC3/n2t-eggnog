N2T.net Partners
================

Individual identifiers are stored in N2T.net by a number of partners.

- `EZID.cdlib.org`_ - making long-term identifiers easy
- `Archive.org`_ - the Internet Archive
- `YAMZ.net metadictionary`_ - open vocabulary of metadata terms

Development partners include

- INCIPIT_ - an identifer service for a consortium of Swiss universities
- Islandora_ - open source digital asset management

`Compact identifiers`_ are implemented with scheme (prefix) records stored in N2T.net in partnership with

- `European Bioinformatics Institute`_ - identifiers.org
- `Prefix Commons`_ - prefixcommons.org

In February 2018 the `California Digital Library`_ and DuraSpace_ (now
LYRASIS_) announced the `ARKs in the Open`_ project, a collaboration aimed at
building an open, international community around Archival Resource Keys (ARKs_)
and their use as persistent identifiers in the scholarly ecosystem.

While not currently storing individual identifiers for them, N2T stores
forwarding records for "shoulders" (described in `Identifier Basics`_), as well
as for "NAANs" on behalf of over 600 different ARK providers, including

- Portico Digital Preservation Service
- The National Library of France
- FamilySearch
- The University of North Texas
- The British Library
- The University of Chicago
- Social Networks and Archival Context Cooperative (SNACC_)

We also have replication arrangements with

- National Library of France
- US National Library of Medicine
- University of Edinburgh

and we engage in ongoing projects and funded work (NSF_, NIH_, IMLS_, Force11_)
with consortia of data archives and publishers such as

- DataCite_
- Crossref_
